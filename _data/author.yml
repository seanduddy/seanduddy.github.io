    Welcome to my website! Here I hope to showcase a little about my personality, as well as some of my personal projects. <br/><br/>
    I hope you can tell from the title of this website/blog hybrid that I am VERY passionate about providing the utmost value in everything I do. <br/><br/>
    I truly believe analytics to be an essential part to success in almost anything; sports, logistics, health science, video games... you name it - it might be easier to think where analytics wouldn't be useful. <br/><br/>
    Looking back on my life I've always loved data and numbers. If you are reading this, I hope you do too (or you at least need someone who does). <br/><br/>
    You can read my articles at the bottom of the page. This is a place where I can share what I learn, and as I'm always learning, I'll constantly be adding to and updating it. Over time I'll be looking to bring in example projects built using open source tools and the modern data stack. I love all things git, dbt, BigQuery, Snowflake, 
    Tableau/PowerBI (although I'm trialling Metabase this week), proper ci/cd and take great pride in transforming typical reporting solutions into modern, performant (cost and time) projects.  <br/><br/>
    I love talking and meeting new people - please drop me a message, I'd love to hear from you.<br/>
