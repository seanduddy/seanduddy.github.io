  <p>
    Welcome to my website! Here I hope to showcase a little about my personality, as well as some of my personal projects. <br/><br/>
    I hope you can tell from the title of this website/blog hybrid, I am VERY passionate about providing the utmost value in everything I do. <br/><br/>
    I truly believe analytics to be an essential part to success in almost anything; sports, logistics, health science, video games... you name it - it might be easier to think where analyics wouldn't be useful. <br/><br/>
    Looking back on my life i've always loved data and numbers. If you are reading this, I hope you do to (or you at least need someone who does). <br/><br/>
    As it stands, the blog is a bit bare, but over time i'll be looking to bring in example projects built using open source tools and the modern data stack. I love all things git, dbt, BigQuery, Snowflake, 
    Tableau/PowerBI (although im trialing Metabase this week), proper ci/cd and take great pride in transforming typical reporting solutions into modern, performant (cost and time) projects.  <br/><br/>
    I love talking and meeting new people - please drop me a message, i'd love to hear from you.<br/>
