_Woes - Brixton Academy - October 2017_

How do you sum up who you are in a few paragraphs? How many of us truly know who we are? I'll be the first to admit im still finding that out but month by month I feel im getting just that little bit closer. I'm always chasing however, as who I am, is ever changing.

In 2017 I was 29 years old and had just started to legitimately break into the UK touring circuit with my band [Woes](https://open.spotify.com/artist/75l6n3i5Hmn8vCUZeMIM6F). By 2018 we would be a regular act throughout Europe and by March 2020 we had called it a day. We burned hard and bright but it was becoming obvious day by day, I was straying further from my true north. I had achieved more than I ever could have hoped for, more than we deserved i'd argue.

Touring is a funny ol' business, a classic glamour indistry, THEE pareto principle career, where the top 10% get 90% of the income - we were firmly in the 90%. A band of our stature rarely gets time to see the wonderous places of the world, you do everything yourself; drive, tech, play, tour manage and sell merch. I don't want to sound bitter or ungreatful, infact actually quite the opposite, many people put their time and energy into us, but with every passing day, I was drifting further from who I truly am... and who I wanted to be.

I am as addicted to writing code and building systems as I was writing and producing music. I know the tenacity and inspiration will wane, it currently ebbs and flows, but im making hay while the sun shines. Im not sure i'll ever be able to extract from life as much as my passion for it demands, another pursuit of mine it seems. I'm sure someone more enlightened would try and tell me that the Tortoise would catch the Hare in the pursuit of happiness, that paradoxically the more you chase, the further from it you become, but while i've still got the legs for it, I won't be slowing down.

These days I make sure to actively practise my gratutide, reminding myself I am in a wonderful industry and comfortable in all aspects of life. I am also grateful that you've taken the time to read this, and have taken an interest in who I am, even at least, if just for a fleeting moment.

Thanks for reading,
Sean
